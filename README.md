## Important
- This project uses bootsrap for some css styling. Make sure you have bootstrap set up as well (just incase npm doesn't do it. I have it installed globaly.)
- To install bootstrap: `npm install bootsrap@3
- For more info visit: http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/

## Getting Started

- The package.json is already there with the correct dependancies.
- Run the development web server using command: `node express_server.js`
- You can also run `npm start` which will also start it but it will also run `nodemon`
